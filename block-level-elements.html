        <h1>Block Elements</h1>
        <p><em>Block elements</em> are elements that are displayed as a block. They take up the full width of a line and are characterized by a line of space before and after the element. You cannot put block level elements inside of inline level elements.</p>
        <p><em>Block elements</em> take up full width and force other element onto a new line.</p>
        <p>You can think of this as a building with <span>room a</span> and <span>room b</span>.</p>
